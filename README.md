# Advice Generator React App

## Description
This is a simple and interactive Advice Generator app built using React.js. The application fetches random advice from the [Adviceslip API](https://api.adviceslip.com/) and displays it in a user-friendly interface. Each time the user presses the "Get Advice" button, a new piece of advice is generated, along with a message indicating the total number of advices received during the session.

## Features
- Fetches random advice from an external API.
- Displays a count of the total advices received.
- Built with React.js fundamentals, including:
  - **useState**: For managing state.
  - **useEffect**: For side effects, like fetching advice from the API.
  - **Props**: For passing data between components.
  - **JSX**: For structuring the UI.

## Components
1. **App Component**: The main component that manages state and handles the logic for fetching advice.
2. **Message Component**: Displays the total number of advices received and any other relevant messages.

## Technologies Used
- React.js
- Adviceslip API : https://api.adviceslip.com/advice
- JSX

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
